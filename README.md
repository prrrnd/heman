This colorscheme is designed to write code in **C**, in very playful retro style colors.

The **heman** theme is inspired by
the **He-Man** action figure series from the 80es and uses a bright rainbow color palette.

```vim Script
    if exists("inner_child")
        byThePowerOfGreyskull();
        iHaveThePower();
    endif
```
